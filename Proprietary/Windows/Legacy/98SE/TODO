Mesa
ide
    slow as all hell but great for compatibility
virtio
    Virtio ok in stage 1 (real mode presumed), stage 2 errors horribly (protected mode?)
    copying to ide produced overflow error?
    Starts up fine from installed though!
scsi supported
    no known driver, but scsi runs in real mode
usb boot
    bsods on the drums, stage 2, then dies since this
    very fast
    startup not always reliable
sata
    fast! good!
